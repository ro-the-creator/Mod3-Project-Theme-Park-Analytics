# Module 3 Final Project - Supernova Theme Park Analytics

<p align=center>
An exploratory analysis project for the theme park Supernova, which has been experiencing uneven guest satisfaction scores in recent months. Issues such as long wait times, inconsistent ride availability, and overcrowding are among the biggest factors contributing to poor satisfaction scores. With a goal of aligning operational efficiency, guest experience, and targeted marketing strategies throughout all departments of the park, this project aims to explore the nuances of park dissatisfaction and recommendations to improve these issues.
